# Make-your-game

This is our version of a popular game [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)

**Instructions**

1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the ship horizontally.
2. Press the Space bar to shoot bullets from the ship to destroy the monsters.
3. Use the Esc key to pause the game.

**Scoring**

- Each monster you destroy will earn you points based on their distance from your ship.
- Monsters closer to your ship will give you lower points, while those farther away will give you higher points.
- Occasionally, a mothership will appear, which gives an extremely high amount of points. Aim for the mothership to boost your score!
- If you run out of lives, you will lose the game.
- If a monster reaches the bottom of the screen, you will lose the game.

Enjoy playing Space Invaders and strive for the highest score possible! Good luck!
